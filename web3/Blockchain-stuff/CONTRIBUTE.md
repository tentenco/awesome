Some tips on contribution

Feel free to make pull requests, however kindly crosscheck in order reduce the number of duplicates that may creep up.

Please use the following format:
[Title][link-can be amazon or goodreads]-Author 

Watch out for whitespaces!!

Feel free to add more categories as well.

I'm open to further suggestions on how to improve this. 

Thanks.
