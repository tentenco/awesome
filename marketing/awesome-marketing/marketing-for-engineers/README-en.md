## 🔎 User Research
User research gives you an answer for whom is your product. Analyzing potential users & customers will help to:
- understand users' needs, pains, motivations and decision-making process; 
- outline product roadmap, key features, UI design and UX scenarios for interacting with your product;
- define the right marketing message (positioning) and choose marketing channels to spread this message;
- make your marketing & communication strategy.

I hope that I have convinced you that user research is very important. After learning these materials you should be able to make user research, create basic Persona and validate it on real people:

* [Marketing and UX personas](https://www.getresponse.com/blog/marketing-persona-vs-ux-persona): how they are similar and different?

> A marketing persona, or buyer persona, is a way to segment target market by common characteristics. It is used to guide media campaigns to target the right audience with the appropriate messaging. Buyer personas usually comes from market research. ... If marketing persona is focused on the WHO, a UX persona is more about the HOW. A UX persona, or design persona, can include all the information in buyer persona, but with additional emphasis on the task-oriented user behavior. What a UX persona wants to uncover is all the steps a target user will take to go from point A to point B. 


* [Design-oriented video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B23iWg0koi8) on performing [basic user research from the UX perspective](https://www.uxbooth.com/articles/complete-beginners-guide-to-design-research/). More good videos & guides on UX personas and research methods: [Creating Personas for User Experience Research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u44pBnAn7cM), [When to Use Which User-Experience Research Methods](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/which-ux-research-methods/)
* Empathy Mapping is one more technique, which widely used in UX for user research. This [Practical Guide to Empathy Maps](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/the-practical-guide-to-empathy-maps-creating-a-10-minute-persona/) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwF9a56WFWA) will give you good overviews of this approach.

You need to reach your potential users and validate your Persona & hypothesis. You can get real users insight through surveys, interviews, online & offline meetings, chats, Skype calls, checking existing analytics (Google Analytics, social media data), analyzing competitors' customers, ethical googling your users' emails & names and researching them on social media:
* 9-min [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5Nt_KRZWtY) on creating a Persona, when you already have something to analyze: website, followers for your product on Twitter\Facebook, first users or paying customers.
* Simple [blueprint](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/market-research-buyers-journey-guide) for conducting a thorough buyer's journey study. It's a bit old article, but it has a nice plan for making user research interviews (study) with current or potential users.   
* [Asking the right questions during user research, interviews and testing](https://uxdesign.cc/asking-the-right-questions-on-user-research-interviews-and-testing-427261742a67) will be in use when you actually start talking to the potential user (😤 you must do this).

👆 User research is an initial part of the customer discovery process. You should not only research your potential users but also test if what you want to build is needed on the market (it’s called Product Market Fit). If you are not familiar with the Lean Startup approach, I advise you to check these resources. It's more startup-oriented, but still relevant for newbie product makers:

## :mag_right: Market Research
How is your product better than other solutions? What is unique about your side project, open-source tool or mobile app? What do you understand about your business that other companies in it just don't get?

You should have answers to all these questions. Market research will help you out! Personally, I define Market Research as a combination of User Research and Competitor Analysis. The first part we discussed in the section above. And these guides will explain how to research your competitors, catch trends and validate market opportunity:

These gave us our first 1000 beta users. So it worth trying out!

## 💎 Content Marketing
Content marketing is about promotion via content. You can run a personal blog, guest blog or write at platforms, like Medium (or combine it). Focus on how you can help your users with your content. You don't have to be a professional writer for making cool articles. Just give yourself space to be creative and share your expertise.

I encourage you to start doing content marketing by yourself. Outsourcing it can be very tricky, especially at the beginning.
🤔 Firstly, think how your blog or content is you going to stand out. There are plenty of cool blogs in every industry. How are you going to be different? What unique value can you offer to your users? How can you build an engaged readers community? And the most important question is how you will convert readers into leads. With all those considerations, you should create a content strategy:
* Before starting ask yourself: [Should You Blog?](https://thestartupchat.com/ep253/) (podcast)
* [How to Use Customer Research to Get Better Results from Your Content Marketing Program](https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/research-for-better-results-content-marketing/) by Crazyegg.

Devesh Khanal has divided the cost into 3 categories: costs per article, salary costs and technology costs. You can repeat his calculations for your case and get approximate budgets.


### :sunglasses: Personal Blog

## :cat: Marketing for Product Hunt Launch
Product Hunt (PH) is a place to discover, share, and geek out about new products in tech. Submitting your product there is a good way to appear in front of journalists, tech people and fellow makers. After submission, the product will participate in the daily race. The race starts PST 00:00 and finishes PST 23:59. You have to get as many upvotes and comments as you can by the end of the day! :trophy: The most successful products appear on the Homepage and can get a lot of honest feedback, downloads, users and PR buzz. Please, check success PH stories to decide if PH is the right launch platform for you!

Start with [basic rules on Posting](https://help.producthunt.com/posting): how to post or comment, how to ask for support, how to get to the homepage. Then read [Five things everyone should know about Product Hunt](https://medium.com/product-hunt/five-things-everyone-should-know-about-product-hunt-fac74f44c32b). Join the PH community and feel how it works, before actually starting you launch activities.

## 📷 Social Media Marketing
Let's start with the basics, which can be used for any social media platform:
* [How to Create a Social Media Marketing Strategy From Scratch](https://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-marketing-plan) by Kevan Lee, Buffer Marketing Director. It's a comprehensive long-read about basic of making your SMM strategy.

📌 Useful SMM toolbox:
* When you have multiple Social Media accounts, use dashboards & tools for managing them in one place. My favorite ones are [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) and [Hootsuite](https://hootsuite.com/) (both have free options). These tools have built-in analytics. So you can pick simple metrics that are meaningful and can be analyzed.
* [Pablo](https://pablo.buffer.com/) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) for fast creating of nice-looking images (both free).

### 🐦 Twitter
I love Twitter as a tool for personal use. Moreover, Twitter has a huge variety of opportunities to promote your product — personal account, company account, Direct Message Marketing, Chats, Adds. Twitter can be used for sharing your articles, connecting with influencers or looking for competitors' customers. As you see, it's a powerful platform for many marketing activities, depending on your goals.  

Your personal account can drive traffic to your product and content. While growing your Twitter followers, you increase the media reach you might get. But don't forget, that Twitter is made for people. To be successful there, you need to communicate with your audience just as you would do offline. If your target audience like your tweets and your personality, there’s a higher chance they will trust you and click on your links:
* [How to Get Higher Tweet Engagement? We Analyzed 23,858 Tweets](https://adespresso.com/academy/blog/get-higher-tweet-engagement-analysis-23858-tweets/) by Karola Karlson. It's a long read about what, when and how to tweet. Although the main focus is on the marketing industry, the key insights will be useful for tech as well.
* [8 Tactics for Increasing Your Twitter Reach](http://www.socialmediatoday.com/social-networks/8-tactics-increasing-your-twitter-reach) by Patrick Whatman.

* Taking part in Twitter chats is a great way to attract new followers and actively participate in relevant conversations with people from your industry.

There is nothing wrong with automating your Twitter activities. You can schedule posts, automatically send messages and set up rules for auto-engagement with users. However, using automation only 🤖 will hurt your SMM strategy. So mix it with real-time tweeting and being active & helpful with the community: 
* [I Automated My Tweets for 30 Days and This is What Happened](https://inbound.org/blog/i-automated-my-tweets-for-30-days-and-this-is-what-happened) by Tami Brehse. Tami scheduled 60 tweets with her blog posts for one month. Her overall site traffic showed how people actually engage with automated tweets.

* [Is “fake” Twitter following working?](https://aggregateblog.com/automated-twitter-following-tools/) by Karola Karlson. New accounts suffer from a lack of followers. Follow-Unfollow tools seem like an obvious solution to give you the "first followers". But in most cases, it will be bots or inactive users.

Direct Message Marketing is about sending personal, mass or automated DMs to your followers. These articles will show you how to use this tool in the right way:
* [7 Twitter Direct Message tactics absolutely anyone can use](https://audiense.com/7-twitter-direct-message-dm-tactics-anyone-social-media-marketing-communications-manager-can-use/) by Paz Segura.

* [Case study when auto-DMs actually were working](http://niknitro.com/auto-dm-not-auto-dm/) by Nik Nitro. Welcome auto-DMs should be used only when it provides tangible value to a new follower. Nik shows his example.
* [Be aware of Twitter tweet & DM limit](https://support.twitter.com/articles/15364).

One more option to consider is Twitter Adds. My experience with Twitter adds was not so positive... especially when I set up the first campaign. So be ready to face poor UX, mysterious errors and bad customer support. Anyway, these guides will help you out:
* [Guide to Twitter Ads: How To Launch an Ad Campaign](https://median-ads.com/en/guides-en/guide-to-twitter-ads-how-to-launch-an-ad-campaign)

* [Scoutzen](https://www.scoutzen.com/) allows you to download Twitter followers from your public or private lists. Pretty useful!

🕴️Use LinkedIn for direct sales and getting partners. You can write people via invitation note, direct message, InMail or Group message. You should have clear objectives and know exactly who you want to connect with. Business outreach is common and popular among LinkedIn members, but it should be done in a structural way:

I heavily use LinkedIn. As you remember, we run [Flawless App](https://flawlessapp.io/?utm_source=Github&utm_campaign=Collection-Marketing-For-Engineers&utm_medium=Free-Collection) — a tool for iOS & macOS engineers. A lot of our users spend time on LinkedIn, participate in iOS groups or post articles there. I often post cool stuff in those groups, engage with people via direct messages or share my writings. Unfortunately, I do get spam or some random requests from job seekers\recruiters. But in general, LinkedIn works for me.   

📌 Useful tools:
* If you need to grow your LinkedIn connection base, use this [script](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10P2Exz5ctRRdvwOaXkFZFTmGcnvv9L5UbBmfPzqKWI8/edit#gid=0). It will automatically add targeted people from the "People You May Know" section. You only need to choose the keywords.
* [Dux-Soup](https://www.dux-soup.com/#see) is another good tool to automatically add LinkedIn connections + send invitations. A free account is not very useful but the paid version is pretty good (worth 15$ a month). It has auto-inviting with personalised messages, auto-messages to 1st-degree connections, downloading your tag-lists with links to profiles.
* [LinkedIn X-Ray Search tool using Google](https://www.lisearcher.com/). With a free account, you only get 100 search results. To get around this limitation you can use X-Ray Searching.

### ❔Quora
Quora is a question-and-answer site, where you can get traffic by helping the community:

## :love_letter: Lifecycle Email Marketing
Lifecycle emails can help you to accomplish almost any marketing goal: onboard new users, increase sales, grow users' engagement, bring back inactive one or build a long-lasting relationship. It's also known as drip marketing or automated email campaigns. To make it simple: it's a set of emails that will be sent out automatically based on schedule, triggers, or user actions. There are four key components for such email campaigns: the right user, goal-oriented topic, good timing and contextual message. 

💻 Let's start with onboarding. The goal of it is to increase the number of users who actually use your product (or free trial) and pay for it later. The onboarding process can be done through in-app messages, live chat messages, product tours, welcome modal windows, well-crafted UX or even phone calls. We will focus on onboarding via emails:

You can work really hard and get a lot of traffic or trial signups. But if your onboarding experience and converting users to customers suck, you will lose the game. 
* For getting an inspiration for your onboarding and product emails, you can check examples from big companies: [Pinterest Onboarding Emails](https://explore.reallygoodemails.com/pinterest-onboarding-emails-2c7fbb0424a9), [Here Are All Of The Emails We Send At Drift](https://blog.drift.com/all-the-emails-at-drift/), [17 Email Scripts That Have Helped Groove Grow Business](https://www.groovehq.com/blog/business-email-templates) and [6 Wearables Tech Email Marketing Examples](https://www.referralsaasquatch.com/wearables-tech-email-marketing-examples/).

🚀 Subscriber emails are good for announcing new feature releases or sharing blog posts. It's also used for sending educational materials or curated content newsletters. All these emails can be an effective tool for growing your existing user's engagement. With newsletters you can gain many email addresses and turn them into users or partners:

## :moneybag: Business Model and Pricing
The business model is the most difficult part of any side-project. It's hard asking people to pay for the product or service.

So we all need to learn how to choose the right business model & pricing strategy and charge our users:
