### Design Feedback Tools

How do you provide and get feedback during the development process? This process is usually pretty messy for many product teams, which caused product delays and time waste on back-and-forth communication. So if you wish to get fast and structural feedback on UI issues or visual bugs — take a look at this tool:

- [Flawless Feedback](https://flawlessapp.io/feedback) — review and annotate iOS apps then share your feedback in Jira or Trello. ![mac.svg](https://github.com/LisaDziuba/Awesome-Design-Tools/blob/master/Media/mac.svg)

Design handoff happens when designers finish the work and need to deliver designs to developers with all specs and assets. Design handoff tools allow to automatically generate style guide, comment on the design, inspect elements. These tools minimize guesswork and improve the effectiveness of the design process.

- [Avocode](https://avocode.com) — open designs without design tools. Export images without preparing layers. Click on layers to get code.

- [Specctr](https://specctr.com) — in the unfortunate event you're designing UI in PS, AI, or ID this tool creates redline annotations.

### Wireframing Tools

A wireframe is a visual mockup that outlines the basic structure of the site or an app. It contains the most essential elements and the content, helping you easily explain ideas on design. Wireframes are a low-fidelity way of showing a design. This section is presented the best wireframing tools for a variety of use cases.
