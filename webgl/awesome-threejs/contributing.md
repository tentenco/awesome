# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this
project you agree to abide by its terms.

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Make sure that your submission is really awesome. Awesome lists are curations of the best, not everything.
- Try to add a short description of the link you are adding by following the convention. Try to credit the author(s) by linking a Twitter/GitHub profile (or website/portfolio): 

For example 
```markdown
- [Name of the resource](<link>): <short description> by [@<author1 nickname>](<link to author1 profile>) & [@<author2 nickname>](<link to author2 profile>)
```
- Choose the best link of all, that makes the navigation and the understanding of the resource the easiest possible. (i.e. prefer linking a GitHub repository over its demo link, moreover if the demo does no link back to the repository. The demo link is certainly linked anyway in the repo)
- Ensure that your submission is in the right category. If it does not fit anywhere, propose a new category or sub-category that we will review in the PR.

Thank you for your suggestions!


## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
